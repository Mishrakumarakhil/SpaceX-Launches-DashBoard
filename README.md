This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
##USE Cases
The dashboard should list all launches of SpaceX.
The User should be able to view the details of the launch on a modal.
The User should be able to filter and see upcoming and past launches.
The User should be able to filter based on a specific start date and end date.
The User should be able to filter based on if the launch was successful.
The User should be able to combine filters. For eg, they should be able to see the successful launches in the past 6 months if needed.
The application should have an empty state and loading state indicator.
After applying the filter, change the URL so that if the user copies the URL and sends it to a friend then the friend should see the data with the filter applied. In other words when the page is refreshed then the filter should NOT be removed. 
Please make sure that the current page is also retained via the URL i.e if you're on the 3rd page and you refresh, the application should be back on the 3rd page itself.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
